Main tasks are in dark green, subtasks in pale green and optional tasks in briliant green (with \# marks).
Tasks in red are likely to change depending on how meetings can be scheduled with diabetic patients.
\section{Reflexions about previous project plan}
Considering the previous Gantt diagram, we can see that milestones that were determined in the initial report were respected and are still available. This can be accounted to the fact that exams and meetings with the staff were taken into account. For the elaboration of this version, some facts were taken into account in order to avoid irrealistic milestones. For instance, some facultative fonctionalities can be developped before finalizing each version. This will allow us to meet our deadlines even if the development is slower than expected.
\\Time for the elaboration of the questionnaire was also allowed in the middle of the period where version 3 will be developped, because the questionnaire should be ready before the end of 3rd version development, but can be done too early while some feedback from the hospital (after demonstrating version 2) is needed to design the questionnaire.
