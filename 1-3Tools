\section{Available tools}
This section is a review on existing tools and software dealing with diabetes. We can roughly divide them in three according to their aims and target users:

\begin{itemize}
\item Tools for diabetes management, used both by medical staff and patients
\item Tools for diabetes education
\end{itemize}

Tools for diabetes education covers software or websites that can be used by medical students and staff, tools that are designed for patients, and tools for the general public. Some of these tools are used by people from different categories. 

\subsection{Simulation tools}
\\label{sec:aidaSection}
TODO: add a picture of aida downloads/connections: still intensely used.
\\
The most important example of a simulation tool is the Aida software\cite{aidaURL1, aidaURL2}. Created in 1991 and made available freely since 1996, this tool simulates the evolution of blood glucose and insulin rates. Many papers descibed the underlying model, and discussed the tool's utility in a teaching purpose, such as~\cite{tatti2001utility}. 

\begin{figure}

  \label{fig:aida1}
\end{figure}

The tool is also available online in ~\cite{aidaURL1, aidaURL2}. Figure~\ref{fig:aida2} is a screenshot of the online version, where graphs corresponding to insulin and glucose blood levels can be displayed. However, this tool is quite difficult to use for a patient or their family, mainly because of the wide number of parameters that can be set and a complex user interface, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:aida1}. It is mainly used to teach medical students. Some preconfigurations are interesting from our perspective, because they represent different profiles among diabetic patient's profiles.

\subsection{Management tools}
Many management tools for diabetes exist. Usually, patients that use insulin pumps can use the matching tool. Harbor Software is a management tool that allows charting, patient monitoring, record and goal managements. It's used by medical staff. \\
[NEW] In ~\cite{arshad2009diabetes}, Diabetes Online Patient Management System (DO-PM) is a project described as a tool aimed for patients to record and analyse their glucose measurements, by making it possible to observe trends and peaks. The tool focuses on its simplicity for records analysis, and the ability to send records to the physian so that an earlier appointment can be decided if needed. Screenshots are available ~\cite{arshad2009diabetes,Do-PmWebsite} but the prototype cannot be tested yet.

\subsection{Educational tools}
Some interactive presentations or websites are available on the internet. 
They are mostly about informing people on diabetes with more or less general information.The tool use diverse mediums, such as, presentations, websites about diabetes for teenagers, blogs and videos. 
\\[NEW] Among them, Your Guide to Diet and Diabetes is an internet website \cite{toolDietAndDiabetesWebsite} released by the University of Illinois, initially for research purposes but it's still freely accessible. The efficiency of this tool was assessed in \cite{herrejon2009creation}.


\subsection{The serious game approach}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Escape from Diab game, screenshot}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{escSc}
  \label{fig:escSc}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Escape from Diab}
Escape from Diab ~\cite{escape} is a game relasead in where the character (see~\ref{fig:escSc}) needs to escape from a city where all citizens are eating junk food and are ill. The player needs to learn about nutrition and to escape from the city. ~\cite{thompson2010serious} explicits the game design, largely based on behavioral theories, including peer impacts and opposition between characters. However, further work is needed to fully understand the way behaviour change is realized from a medical perspective.
\\It wasn't possible to test the game because access is not available.

\paragraph{Recent online games}

Two online games were developed in 2011 by the diabetes society les Diablotines available in ~\cite{gluci}. These adventure games focus mainly on carbohydrate counting for diabetes, in the frame of an investigation adventure, in order to be in a good condition to investigate. 
The main characters are reporters or adventurous people. However, l'affaire birman and Time Out become quickly repetitive. There is a lack of freedom, making the user wait during quite long times.
