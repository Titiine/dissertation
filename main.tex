\chapter{Introduction}
%Something like: "Diabetes is [lieu commun, blabla]. Puis diabetes et education" %sentence?
\section{Diabetes}
Diabetes is a disease characterized by a failure in the glycemic regulation system, when there is too much
sugar in the patient's blood. In a sound organism, energy can be used by the body \warn{for muscle movement and other uses} when there is enough glucose and insulin\warn{, which is needed to convert glucose into energy by the body cells}. Glucose comes from eaten food, while insulin is a chemical hormone normally produced by the pancreas. In case of diabetes, there is no insulin (type 1) or the insulin cannot be used efficiently by the body (type 2). In this project, we will focus on type 1 diabetes, which was also called juvenile diabetes in the past as it's mostly diagnosed in children and young adults.\\There is still no cure for diabetes. However, patients can control their diabetes with different treatments. Treatment success relies mostly on the ability to manage one's own glucose levels. Therefore, patient education is crucial. 
When patients are diagnosed, they are educated about diabetes in the hospital during some days, and learn how to do blood testing and injections. Dietetic educational sessions are also held, since some knowledge about food, energy and carbohydrate counting is needed directly after patients leave the hospital. Patient education continues for some months or even years in order to help them enhance their diabetes management.

\section{Simulations to enhance education}
A lack of education about diabetes can have fatal consequences, leading in some cases to coma
or death. We focus on teenagers' education, accounted to be the most challenging to achieve because teenagers are known to be the hardest to teach, \warn{commonly considering that lectures are boring and repetitive~\cite{paulino2011knowing}}. Indeed, as adolescence is a period where teenagers are progressively gaining their independence, they tend to consider adult's supervision as an annoyance.
%Hanna KM and Guthrie DW stated in [HG01]%

For this purpose, using a virtual environment to provide an immersive experience is expected to be much more effective, knowing the usual attractiveness of gaming for a generation of teenagers more comfortable with a mouse than a pen in hand. 
%More used to mice than pens%

Simulations have been widely used for educational purposes\warn{~\cite{ellington1981games}}. Two main uses of simulations can be distinguished: instructional simulations, that can be compared to lectures, and training simulations, similar to experimental sessions. \warn{In~\cite{alinier2007typology}, these two main uses are defined and subclassified into 6 ``levels'', for which the mode of delivery is specified, either as student-led or trainer-led.} We will see \warn{in section~\ref{sec:simulationUsages}} that our tool enables both of these usages, depending on whether the user wants to acquire new knowledge or prefers experiencing the effects of diabetes on health in a safe environment \warn{rather than in the real world.} 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{A classroom in simSchool}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{classarea_simschool.jpg}
  \label{fig:classarea_simschool}
\end{figure}


As a comparison, teachers can experiment their teaching skills in a virtual classroom with simSchool rather than a real classroom, to avoid the risk of damaging real students. An example of a simSchool classroom is given in figure~\ref{fig:classarea_simschool}.In this 3D realistic world, it would be possible to see how diabetes affects concretely the way patients live, work or do any other activity they usually do in real life. Patients can learn about their disease, and even experiment extreme %several%
behaviours to see both short term and long term consequences. For this purpose, time can be speeded up, to show things that cannot be experimented %by any practical or lecture% in real life.%, which they are supposed to avoid in real life for health reasons.%
\section{OpenSimulator}
To develop such a 3D simulation, several alternatives can be considered. After studying them, the most suitable was chosen in accordance with the constraints that will be discussed in section~\ref{sec:toolsConstraints}.
OpenSimulator is the virtual environment chosen to build this simulation. Among the famous virtual environments, we can cite Second Life~\cite{SLOfficialWebsite} developed by Linden Labs~\cite{LindenOfficialWebsite}, and the game World of Warcraft~\cite{wowWebsite}. 
OpenSimulator is similar to Second Life as people inside can own virtual land, create virtual objects, meet each other and attend socializing events such as parties or concerts. The OpenSimulator project was created in 2008 after the open-sourcing of the 3D client of Second Life. %NEED TO BE SOURCED Thus, a certain amount of interoperability between the two servers exists. 
\warn{Many universities created a virtual campus where lectures can be attended (such as San Jose State University~\cite{graves2008second}) and projects to train medical staff (like the Virtual Neurological Education Centre developed by the University of Plymouth~\cite{boulos2007second}), }or run industrial simulations make a wide use of OpenSimulator as it's an open-source software.
\warn{(Unuseful, to be removed :) OpenSimulator needs a client to connect to the server, as we need a browser to connect the web. A standalone version can also be used, in which case a local server %hosted in the user machine%
replaces the connection to a distant server over the internet.}

\warn{\section{Motivations}}
%COPIED FROM the 3 requirements (aims) of the simulation, in analysis :
Besides, the software should provide a motivational way to manage diabetes, trying to make patients aware of how they can take advantage of a well managed diabetes.  This can be done with examples, by using non playing characters like successful story tellers. The non playing avatar can be a passionate athlete, explaining that without using the best management practices, he won't be able to do sport. \\


%\warn{\section{Hypothesis}} SECTION (with 2 hypothesis) MOVED IN DESIGN


%COPIER AILLEURS : For this purpose, providing a tool with the capability of making you learn continously is opening up very promising prospects for further studies about diabetes education.
%Moreover, such a tool could be even more efficient than group sessions with standardized lectures for all students, as it suits every user's needs because the proposed material takes into account its own memorization capacities, providing personalized and adapted content.\\


\iffalse COPIER AILLEURS Furthermore, the complete immersion in virtual world strengthens the feeling of being active, which is one of the main requirements for an ideal teaching solution for young adults. Here, the simulation requires from the user to manage his avatar's diabetes correctly to be rewarded. For this purpose, the user needs to know diabetes mechanisms, and learn the day-to-day techniques used in diabetes management. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HORS SUJET : WOW et addictivité, pour rendre l'utilisation de l'outil quotidienne

Moreover, World of Warcraft (WoW) addictiveness, that was decried by many specialists, could be beneficial to our tool. If only a part of this addictiveness mechanisms can be reproduced, the day to day training on diabetes and diabetes-related skills enhancement will be made possible. This point is extremely crucial because users a expected to use the tool on a regular basis, in order to avoid the problems met by previous attempts to design similar educational tools about diabetes, such as... (examples in intro ?). These results are detailed in section~\ref{sec:resultsOfToolReview}\\

Contrary to what might sometimes be believed, addictiveness of WoW lies more in the than in the community life players experience than in the interest for the game itself. Obviously, the game design is already good, but it is not enough to explain the extreme consequences that were sometimes observed, such as players that doesn't sleep for more than one day because there were continously playing to WoW. 

\subsection{Results of the educational tools review}
\label{sec:resultsOfToolReview}
\subsubsection{``Gamy'' tools}
What resulted from the overview of the available tools is that usually, tools on diabetes education are either too close to (quite simple) games, with a ``diabetes-friendly'' educational ``overlay'', but with quite poor educational content about diabetes. EXAMPLE : ...
The first advantage of this kind of games is that the user won't get bored very quickly, as he will consider himself as playing, rather being involved in an educational task. There will be very few differences on his perception of playing the diabetes game or playing a normal video game, according to ... (remember the study with children that don't find the game better when we removed diabetes).\\

The second advantage is that this kind of game will be suitable for diabetic as well as non diabetetic players.\\
As a conclusion, we can say that this kind of game is more interesting for the case of younger diabetics, because:
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of information they need to learn about diabetes is not as important as the one needed for a teenager, because their parents are mainly in charge of the diabetes management at that time.
\item The game provides a positive experience about diabetes, usually with heros
\end{itemize}

Thus, this kind of game can be used by educators as a perfect introduction to encourage or get patients used to mae use of educational softwares about diabetes.

\subsubsection{Serious tools}
The other kind of educational software about diabetes were designed more as a learning tools, such as forums and materials on various topics, than games. They were not designed to entertain people, but to provide a convenient and attractive tool for diabetes education. A tool that should also suit the teenagers needs.\\

This kind of tool is quite unlikely to be designed to suit both diabetic and non-diabetic people's needs, because they aren't supposed to look for the same kind of knowledge. For instance, in TimeOut, carbohydrates counting is used during all the mission. It is an efficient and playfull way to train teenagers with this technique, and the repetivity of the game concerning this precise point is probably a strenght. However, it is the main knowledge taught in this tool, which means that whenever the user matters this technique, the game becomes boring. Furthermore, it might be difficult to find it interesting for a non diabetic player, because the need to learn and make use of carbohydrates counting isn't strong enough as there is no strong motivation to do so: the only consequence of a good diabetes management will result on a higher score at the end of the game.\\

\subsubsection{Consequences on our design}
Studying these mechanisms allows us to develop various attempts to highly involve the user to achieve good diabetes management. 

\subsubsection{The Tamagotchi case}
The example of Tamagotchis~\cite{holzinger2001triangle} is very instructive from this perspective : how a simple virtual pet device with limited functionalities can entail such a high involvment from users ? The Tamagotchi is a virtual pet that need to be carefully breed in order to keep it alive as long as possible. Technically, the Tamagotchi was a small device with three buttons, beeping when the user has to take care of it. \\
Initially launched in Japan by Bandai in 1996, the Tamagotchi became quickly extremely popular among teenagers. Highly relayed by the press, adults became rapidly affected by this phenomenon.\\

\section{Structure of this report}

\warn{Chapter 2 is dedicated the background. Diabetes is explained in more detail, before reviewing existing attempts to model how diabetes works on glucose and insulin amounts and the most important contributions of software tools in the fields of diabetes monitoring and education. The second section stresses more on the close links between adolescence, diabetes and various issues as investigated in a large range of articles. This part includes various subjects, from eating disorders to psychological and behavioural issues, but most of them are linked with quality of life and education about diabetes. Such a large overview is needed in order to identify specific educational issues with diabetic teenagers, in order to figure out the more suitable approach that can be followed by the software. 
Chapter 3 presents the main advancements done in the project for various fields. We begin with a clarification of the requirements and needs that were learned with the help of meetings with the diabetes team of Royal Manchester Childrens Hospital, and the newly diagnosed educational sessions I was allowed to follow in the hospital. In section~\ref{sec:matmodel}, the mathematical model of evolution of insulin and glucose concentrations in the blood is described. Then, a description of the technical choices made for the implementation is set, followed by the chosen architecture for the software. Last part presents the main developments that were done.
In the third chapter, the project plan is given, describing what is going to be implemented, software assessment and the principal milestones.}

%OpenSim, which is the open source version, would be better to suite this purpose because it

%up to standard. Thus, this project  is aimed to find the best way to teach cellular network

\chapter{Old report}
\section{Summary}
\subsection{Context}
Diabetes is a disease that requires a daily constant monitoring from the patient and an ability for self-care management. For this purpose, patients need to be educated about their disease to be able to take care of themselves. This becomes especially challenging in the case of teenagers, since they are progressively gaining their independence. 
Furthermore, Hanna KM and Guthrie DW stated in~\cite{HannaKM} that it's harder to teach them because they tend to consider adult's supervision as an annoyance.
\paragraph{}
This industrial MSc Project is led by the University of Manchester and the adolescent Diabetic clinic of the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. The hospital is responsible of accompaniment sessions for diabetic children and teenagers. These sessions might use of a large range of educational supports, from videos and activities to novels. Considering the attractiveness of gaming for teenagers, we may think that playful tools can improve knowledge hand-over, and help to raise their awareness on points that are often neglected. 

\subsection{Diabetes}
Diabetes is characterized by a failure in the glycaemic regulation system, when there's too much sugar in the patient's blood. As shown in figure 1, in a sound organism, energy is produced when glucose and insulin react. In case of diabetes, there is no insulin (type 1) or the insulin cannot be used by the body (type 2).
\\
\includegraphics{diabetes_drawing}

\subsection{Objectives}
We want to address two issues: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve patient's education about his disease,
\item Raise the awareness of patient's entourage.
\end{itemize}
% IL MANQUE LA REF!!! ET IL FAUT INTRODUIRE LA CITATION: As XXX stated: blabla
\paragraph{} 
A lack of education about diabetes can have fatal consequences, leading in some cases to coma or death. In order to provide more effective for adolescent's education, we want to develop an interactive and adaptive software. Teaching experience can be improved by the use of 3 Dimensional interactive worlds, as they offer an Immersive experience to the user. Such as virtual reality, this kind of environments offers new possibilities for adaptive teaching methods, and their growing importance in motivational reinforcement have been recently studied by Ershow~\cite{virtual_reality}.

Our objective is to develop a tool where the user is an avatar that can be diabetic. In this 3D realistic world, it would be possible to see how diabetes affects the way patients live, work or do any other activity they usually do in real life. Patients can learn about their disease, and experiment several behaviours to get a better understanding. For this purpose, we want to add a diabetic avatar in an existing 3D world. 

\paragraph{}
% Normalement on met pas ca au debut, on commence par une lettre
3D worlds can also help to reach our second objective, linked with patient's entourage: even though family and friends have a huge impact in diabetes, there's an obvious need for education here because it's not possible that they all attend lectures in the hospital. Peers pressure is an especially relevant factor during adolescence, while patients can follow teens that aren't aware of the possible harmfulness of their activities~\cite{relatives}.
With this kind of universe, relatives, or anyone interested can use another avatar, and take part into the simulation. This might lead to a better understanding of their interactions with ill people, and the way diabetics live as well.

\section{Deliverable}
We want to produce a prototype that can be used at least by the hospital staff before the end of the project, e.g. in September. 
Then, we want to assess the ability of the tool to meet our expectations.


\subsection{Features}
The software will include features among these three categories, according to the time and planning changes:

\begin{itemize}
\item A teaching tool:
Images, videos or web pages can be displayed.
MCQ can also be used, and content can be added by the hospital staff.

\item Attractivity:
Users can communicate with other people at the simulation this day if it's done in the hospital, or with their friends by inviting them.
We can add adaptive content and can take into account the users' 'category' i.e. age, gender and other characteristics that might be relevant to determine which content to display.

\item Simulation:
An interface where main indicators are displayed, such as glucose, insulin level in the blood will be available. Then, we can run a simulation by "eating" something and looking at the indicators' evolution. 
A tour can be recorded, so a new user can follow a predefined route, where an overview of the main events a diabetic can go through is shown.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test}
After producing the prototype, we want to measure the impact of this tool in the education of teenagers. For this purpose, we will give multiple choice questions to the patients after they used the tool.
We will focus both on strict memorization performances, such as more concepts kept in mind by users, or a low forgetting rate, and on the attractiveness for the users. The tool must be able to adapt to the user, e.g. not delivering inappropriate content in the way it can be too complex to understand given the faculties of the user, or appear too childish for a teenager. Techniques from artificial intelligence are to be used, such as ontologies. However, building an accurate model of the student is not expected for this prototype. We need to reach a level of maturity that is acceptable according to the hospital staff expectations, and that matches our main modelling objectives.

\subsection*{Achievability}
A comparison has already been done between several tools and technology that can be used, such as:
Unity3D,
Open Simulator,
Second Life,
Gaming libraries, such as pygame or the Lightweight Java Game Library,
or a mobile application. 
We chose Open Simulator for the development, as many features are already provided: communication with others, object modelling and creation, avatar and physical engine.
Technically, there is no excessively tricky technology or architecture to use.

\section{Planning}

There is a lot to learn about diabetes and patients daily life before being able to clarify my requirements. Therefore, the project depends a lot on the meetings with hospital staff. In addition, the large wide of techniques and subjects that could be covered in this project make it achievable only if I clearly restrict the scope.
However, we can state that the key features consists on these points :
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a model for sugar and insulin evolution rates in the blood
\item Modelling a system of feeding with some food objects
\item Enabling the display of educational material in at least one teaching support
\item Building a few effects representing some diabetes symptoms
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


This is an example of use of Aida software. 50 cases are available, corresponding to different people with various problems, such as being used to high blood glucose during the night or a too low blood glucose in the afternoon.
The user chooses a case an specifies the food intakes, with the carbohydrate amounts and when the food was taken. The injected units of insulin with the corresponding times are also specified. Then, we can run the simulation.

We took case number 2, known as Howard Kistler. He is a type 1 diabetes that wants to improve his injection program by changing the doses of insulin. 

Here is the description as found on the website:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Description of case number 2 as found on Aida website}
  This 45 year old man was diagnosed as having diabetes at the 
age of 14. He is currently on a regimen of combined short 
and/or intermediate acting insulin preparations four times 
per day.  As you can see from his home monitoring blood 
glucose measurements, he tends to higher blood glucose 
values overnight but has a low blood glucose in the 
mid-morning.  Try using the simulator to see how you 
could redistribute his insulin doses to improve his 
overall control.
  \centering
\\  \label{descriptionCaseAida}
\end{figure}


He was treated with short 3 insulin injections and 2 long-acting ones, as described in figure~\ref{a1}. He had hypoglycemia in the middle of the morning and hyperglycemia during the night.
We corrected the doses as shown in figure~\ref{a3}, reducing the amount of the quick insulin injected in the morning, and adding units to the late afternoon dose and at midnight.

The results for both cases are displayed in figure~\ref{a2}. The results for the the initial doses of insulin are shown in red, with a positive peak during the night and a negative peak during the morning. 
In the improved doses (in red), the high blood glucose during the night is lowered, and the mid-morning hypoglycemia is corrected. However, blood levels become too low at 3 in the night, so the simulation can still be improved.

The tool helps to understand the effects of insulin injections and food intakes on the blood glucose.
