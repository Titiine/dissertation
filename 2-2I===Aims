\section{What to stimulate ?}
\subsection{Aims of the simulation}

High level requirements of the software can be categorized into three aims:

%A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SERIOUS GAMES
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Increasing user's knowledge about diabetes}, and / or developping a better understanding of diabetes mechanisms. \\
Target users include patients, their relatives and their friends. The software can also be used for teaching the general public as an awareness raising tool.\\
The educational goal will be achieved by providing educational content in traditional forms, such as text, pictures, animations or videos, but also with the 3D simulation where users can train on diabetes-specific techniques like carbohydrate counting, (virtual) insulin injection, and blood testing.\\
Assessment modules will be provided in order to enhance the educational experience: traditional Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), but also real time training where the avatar has to perform correctly the learned technique in the 3D environment.

\item \textbf{Improving diabetes management}\\
The simulation will be used here from a practice perspective. The patient will be able to test and observe the consequences of several actions and lifestyles in complete safety. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia would be shown. For more precision, a 2D web based graphical simulation will be accessible so that the user can keep track of the changes in their state over time. \\
For patients that were diagnosed longer ago, a collection of tips on various topics will be available so that they can find solutions to improve their management. These tips either consulted independently, or proposed as suggestions by the user interface as it's usually done in many software with ``tips of the day'' pop-ups. These suggestions can be based on management techniques used by diabetes teams or on testimonies, both put in the form of ``videos'', or interactive sequences. For instance, ideas about how to tell a friend that you have diabetes or how to inject when you are not alone can be demonstrated.

\item \textbf{Improving the quality of life}\\
When used by newly diagnosed patients, the tool can give them more confidence in diabetes management and provide useful tips that can help to cope with the problems they encounter. During the first stay in the hospital, the tool can be a support for the educational sessions they attend: the approach is more playfull than a classic session, and could represent something positive, maybe the first positive experience about diabetes during their stay in the hospital.\\
Besides, the software should provide a motivational way to manage diabetes, trying to make patients aware of how they can take advantage of a well managed diabetes.  This can be done with examples, by using non playing characters like succesful story tellers. The non playing avatar can be a passionate athlete, explaining that without using the best management practices, he won't be able to do sport. \\
[TOPICTURE] Community based approach, allowed by the connected features of Opensimulator on which avatars from all over the world can connect, discuss and do activities together in the same map, can benefit from the attractivity of an online community. Sharing with people that have the same disease can help combatting the feeling of difference and loneliness patients can feel.
