High level requirements of the software can be categorized into three aims:
%http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/267690/1/3711a021.pdf
%A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SERIOUS GAMES
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Increasing user's knowledge about diabetes}, and / or developping a better understanding of diabetes mechanisms. \\
Target users include patients, their relatives and their friends. The software can also be used for teaching the general public as an awareness raising tool.\\
%suite coupée

\item \textbf{Improving diabetes management}\\
The simulation will be used here from a practice perspective. The patient will be able to test and observe the consequences of several actions and lifestyles in complete safety. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia would be shown. For more precision, a 2D web based graphical simulation will be accessible so that the user can keep track of the changes in their state over time. \\
%suite coupée

\item \textbf{Improving the quality of life}\\
When used by newly diagnosed patients, the tool can give them more confidence in diabetes management and provide useful tips that can help to cope with the problems they encounter. During the first stay in the hospital, the tool can be a support for the educational sessions they attend: the approach is more playful than a classic session, and could represent something positive, which might be the first ``positive experience'' about diabetes during their stay in the hospital. Sharing with people that have the same disease can also help combating the feeling of difference and loneliness patients can feel.\\

For patients diagnosed long ago, a community based approach, allowed by the connected features of OpenSimulator on which avatars from all over the world can connect, discuss and do activities together in the same map, can help to get peer support and may represent a way to share positive experiences. % TO PUT SOMEWHERE ELSE benefit from the attractiveness of an on-line community.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% COMMENT L'OUTIL VA AMELIORER LES 3 POINTS

Here is a description of which functionalities are needed to achieve the three aims described previously as high level requirements of the software.

%http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/267690/1/3711a021.pdf
%A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SERIOUS GAMES

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Increasing user's knowledge about diabetes}\\
The educational goal will be achieved by providing educational content in traditional forms, such as text, pictures, animations or videos, but also with the 3D simulation where users can train on diabetes-specific techniques like carbohydrate counting, (virtual) insulin injection, and blood testing.\\
Assessment modules will be provided in order to enhance the educational experience: traditional Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), but also real time training where the avatar has to perform correctly the learned technique in the 3D environment.

\item \textbf{Improving diabetes management}\\
To improve diabetes management, a distinction need to be made between users that are newly diagnosed patients and other diabetics.\\

For new patients, the focus will be put on recall the steps and important points for each technique, such as changing the injection site for each insulin injection in order to avoid damaging the skin. Videos can provide the advices, and tests can be used to check if the various steps and the precautions are correctly known.\\

For patients that were diagnosed longer ago, a collection of tips on various topics will be available so that they can find solutions to improve their management. These tips either consulted independently, or proposed as suggestions by the user interface as it's usually done in many software with ``tips of the day'' pop-ups. These suggestions can be based on management techniques used by diabetes teams or on testimonies, both put in the form of ``videos'', or interactive sequences. For instance, ideas about how to tell a friend that you have diabetes or how to inject when you are not alone can be demonstrated.

\item \textbf{Improving the quality of life}\\
%% PUT in aims
\iffalse
When used by newly diagnosed patients, the tool can give them more confidence in diabetes management and provide useful tips that can help to cope with the problems they encounter. During the first stay in the hospital, the tool can be a support for the educational sessions they attend: the approach is more playful than a classic session, and could represent something positive, maybe the first positive experience about diabetes during their stay in the hospital.
\fi

A system of friends, text messages, voice conversations need to be provided, and the players should be able to give objects to their friends and to participate jointly in activities and games. We may also think of a system that is similar to online forums to keep a track about the interesting content that could be discussed publicly.

\end{enumerate}

%moved from the other file (usecases):
\subsubsection{Use cases}\\

In order to meet the requirements described above, we need to figure out educational content that can be used for the tool. 

A list of example use cases, described according to the topic, are shown in the following figures.

\paragraph{Content to be used by the software}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case 1: Insulin is not taken correctly}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{bulle1}
  \label{fig:bulle1}
\end{figure}

Insulin treatment is rarely correctly implemented: only 15\% of families can meet the criteria for good glucose management. %TODO : find a reference.
In figure~\ref{fig:bulle1}, various reasons are considered as causes for poor insulin treatment, as enumerated in the circles. In the case of (1), the problem comes from a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge or poor skills to correctly handle diabetes management. Thus, the user can use the software to increase his knowledge about diabetes if needed, including carbohydrate counting and injections. \warn{Then, playing with the simulation as a training for diabetes management can help understand the mechanisms of glucose regulation.} %Tips can be provided in the adapted section of the software.
\\Sometimes, the lack of knowledge, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:bulle3}, is a barrier that prevents good glucose management. For instance, when patients tend to feel afraid of the risk of having an hypoglycemia in class because they will have to eat, they tend to lower their insulin injection to avoid this situation. \warn{In this case, it can trigger the hyperglycemia symptoms, especially that the patient frequently need to urinate, which might be a bigger embarrassment than eating in the class.}
Motivations to do well can be found for the youngest teenagers by describing symptoms that are socially embarrassing. Making the avatar look and behave in a silly way when he is low can represent a dramatic visual scene.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case 2: Treatment is a psychological burden}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{bulle2}
  \label{fig:bulle2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Use case 3: Misconceptions}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{bulle3}
  \label{fig:bulle3}
\end{figure}


\warn{Among the use case 1, in figure~\ref{fig:bulle1}, here are other examples that can be developed in the simulation:}
\paragraph{1. The child doesn't want to take insulin}
Some young patients try to avoid injection because of the discomfort or the pain. The fear of looking different or weak is another reason of neglecting diabetes management.
This list of arguments, based on some advice from the nurse, can be used to help:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Going to the hospital with ketoses is much more annoying than taking your insulin''
\item ``Going to the loo many times during school-time is a bigger embarrassment than having an injection in front of your friends''
\item ``You can show your courage ! Most of them are afraid of needles''
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{2. Patients lowering the injected doses}
This can be done in order avoid weight gain
As stated in ~\cite{InsulinMisuse}, insulin misuse is sometimes noted during adolescence among girls mainly.
A personalized intelligent approach can be relevant here. With the weight or the BMI (Body Mass Index), it's easy to identify users that can be concerned by this phenomenon and to raise their awareness and suggest them a diet plan to tackle the issue of insulin-related weight gain. \cite{AnneMarie2013A128}
%http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363613721700
%Les adolescentes ayant un diabète de type 1 et étant en surpoids : une approche éducative spécifique
suggested that a specific approach for female teenagers who are overweight gave good results in the changes in their BMI, on self perception, and on their motivation in diabetes management.


\warn{In the same motivational and proactive perspective, the approach chosen in the prototype developed for our project can lead to positive changes on diabetes management. }

In the educational part of the software, we try to develop a motivational and positive approach to diabetes management. Indeed, instead of emphasizing the symptoms and all the negative effects diabetes management can have on health, we try to show diabetes management as a way to achieve great things in life. On the one hand, diabetes should not be seen as a limitation. On the other hand, diabetes management is the key criteria they should tend to master in order to be free to live the way they want. 
Some non playing avatars can be used to expose these kind of ideas. Passionate people can be used as non playing avatars, explaining that they do their best to manage their diabetes and live their passion. We can expect adolescent to take them as examples in an identification process, like the way teenagers commonly identify with celebrities.

	%OLD : \warn{\section{Hypothesis}} this SECTION was in the end of INTRODUCTION
\warn{\subsection{Hypothesis}} 
Various hypothesis will be tested with this project, all closed related to the improvement of diabetes education experience. 
%%%%%%%%%% HYP 1
\paragraph{First hypothesis}An educational tool based on a virtual environment can be a powerful tool to offer an enriched experience to users
that cannot be found in:
\begin{itemize}
\item the usual theoretical content find in the leaflet 
\item the practical aspects of diabetes educational sessions, given by the hospital 
%\item and also more than simple real life experience usually given to train about diabetes (blood testing, insulin injections...).est whether there is a way to teach 
\end{itemize}
Indeed, about the last point, a virtual simulation can offer a way to experiment situations that cannot be replicated safely in real life during the sessions, such as symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
%=> Results : in the results part, discussing the different kind of uses of such a simulation

%%%%%%%%%% HYP 2
\paragraph{Second hypothesis}A test-driven learning policy could bring enhancements in two key points:\\
1) The quality of teaching can be improved, because we are able to detect:
\begin{itemize}
\item What isn't already known by the user: this knowledge can be a frame to provide the user only useful content.
\item What is hard to keep in mind, or what tends to be forgotten from time to time: this knowledge can provide a way to test it regularly to make sure that a constant minimum level of knowledge is known.
\end{itemize}

%=> in results, talk about normal mode and learning mode (cf implementation or design)\\

The latest point is especially important, given the results of studies that showed, firstly, that a better knowledge about diabetes, provided by special educational sessions to teenagers, improves their diabetes management and reduces the risks of complications\benfac{~\cite{}}. Secondly, it was also shown that the benefits taken from these sessions don't last more than about 36 months counting from the end of the sessions\benfac{~\cite{}}. 

2) The motivation and interest of the learners can be improved.\\
The reluctance of adolescents for traditional teaching materials and methods such as books and lectures could be overcome by a tool that is very similar to 3D gaming environments they are familiar with and found of, such as the Sims or World of Warcraft.\\
Furthermore, the complete immersion in virtual world strengthens the feeling of being active, which may enhance the efficiency of the educational tool.\\
Enhancing the attractiveness of the tool is another interesting approach. We may consider that the on-line community mentioned in section~\ref{sec:needsAnalysis} can be an efficient way to take advantage of the well known addictiveness of MMO games, since the latter is considered as relying heavily on the social links built in-game among the community.  



%%%%%%%%%% HYP 3
\paragraph{Third hypothesis}%The motivation to learn provided by 
The tool can be adapted to multiple profiles such as patients, parents, newly diagnosed patients, and friends. \warn{This may be enabled by analysing the needs of each category, and providing adapted features. For instance, this could be done by using educational content that is personalized for each category.}
